<p><i>Poetic potentials of computer code</i></p>

<span class="tldr"><b>TL;DR</b> <br>
<p>
Java Sonnets, C++ Ballads and Python Haikus? Why not!<br>
Poetry + Coding = The New Avant-Garde<br>
<b>Join us in India’s first poetry jam featuring poems written in computer code, performed by humans and machines. </b><a href="#signup">RSVP below!</a><br>

Expected Nerd Level for Listeners/Watchers = 0<br>
Nerd Level of Featured Code Poets = Jedi<br>

<h2 class="long">WHAT is co-po-jam?</h2>
<p>In this first experiment of co-po-jam we explore code poetry through interactive code poetry, visual code poetry, black out poetry generators. We also explore the world of sentiment analysis in context of literature, speculative fiction through machine learning generated texts, and much more.

We will create cutting edge poems in code. We will also perform, collaborate and hang out with humans, machines and other poets at the CO-PO-JAM.

It is an open-to-all online event where we get together to interact, watch and be pleasantly shocked as some jedi-level creative technologists showcase their poetic performances.

We invite coders and non-coders alike to come together in exploring the intersections of code and poetry. At co-po-jam we encourage experiments, trials and attempts with the use of programming syntax, creative visualizations through code, understanding the concepts of Natural Language Processing.</p>

<h2 class="long">WHY co-po-jam?</h2>
Co-po-jam is an opportunity for writers, artists and technologists to collaborate in non-formalised ways. An experimental space to discover, hypothesise and speculate on the nature of writing in the digital age.
