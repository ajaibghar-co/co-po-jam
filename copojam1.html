<h2 class="eventName"><b>co</b>(de)-<b>po</b>(etry)-<b>jam</b></h2>
<p><i>Poetic potentials of computer code</i></p>

<div class="tldr"><h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>
Java Sonnets, C++ Ballads and Python Haikus? Why not!<br>
Poetry + Coding = The New Avant-Garde<br>
<b>Join us in India’s first poetry jam featuring poems written in computer code, performed by humans and machines. </b><a href="#signup">RSVP below!</a><br>

Expected Nerd Level for Listeners/Watchers = 0<br>
Nerd Level of <a href="#presenters">Featured Code Poets = Jedi</a><br>

<h2 class="long">WHAT is co-po-jam?</h2>
<p>In this first experiment of co-po-jam we explore code poetry through interactive code poetry, visual code poetry, black out poetry generators. We also explore the world of sentiment analysis in context of literature, speculative fiction through machine learning generated texts, and much more.

We will create cutting edge poems in code. We will also perform, collaborate and hang out with humans, machines and other poets at the <b>co-po-jam</b>.<br>
<br>

It is an <b>open-to-all online event</b> where we get together to interact, watch and be pleasantly shocked as some jedi-level creative technologists showcase their poetic performances.

We invite coders and non-coders alike to come together in exploring the intersections of code and poetry. At co-po-jam we encourage experiments, trials and attempts with the use of <b>programming syntax, creative visualizations through code, understanding the concepts of Natural Language Processing.</b></p>

<h2 class="long">WHY co-po-jam?</h2>
<p>co-po-jam is an opportunity for writers, artists and technologists to collaborate in non-formalised ways. <b>An experimental space to discover, hypothesise and speculate on the nature of writing in the digital age.</b></p>

<p class="bio">Hugo is a designer trying to make sense of the world we've built for ourselves while exploring alternative modes of living, earning, and thinking, one project at a time.
</p>
<p>The program is a designed to ask the big questions, always. By using a deceivingly simple question structure similar to that which an inquisitive child might likely use, it is designed to help its reader consider the most (un)likely of circumstances.

<p class="bio">Jazer is an interaction designer with a playful itch for coding, and making experimental interfaces that explore the realms of art and computation.
</p>
<p>Jazer will be presenting a blackout poetry generator that explores five different modes of poem creation — a comparative to collaborative interface between a bot and the author. Each mode will conclude with a generated poem.

<p class="bio">Creative Coder & Performative Programmer, who uses Coding, Poetry, Music, Visuals in conjunction with other mediums to enhance experiences.
</p>
<p>For Dra.ft, he will be using creative/live coding tools alongside poetry to show that code is poetry and poetry is code . Bringing the visuals AND SONIC ELEMENTS TO ALIGN WITH THE WORDS and vice versa</p>

<p class="bio">Praveen is an Interaction Designer, UX Educator & New Media Practitioner, who makes eclectic mix of work primarily based on code & storytelling.
</p>
<p>Interpreting a physical action based algorithm to generate Haiku, with AR filter as the medium & Spark AR as the coding tool. The algorithm involves tilting ones head 3 times to write a Haiku. The head tilt interaction was inspired from the infamous indian "head-nod". Praveen will be showcasing the instagram filter and also few clips of users hacking the algorithm and exploring layered interpretations.

<p class="bio">Priti is an information designer who works at the intersection of design, technology & code.</p>
<p>The rapid co-evolution of technology and typography has uncovered possibilities for creating immersive experiences that push the limits of expressivity. Increasingly, emerging forms of media are beginning to encompass temporal and interactive behaviours. This project envisions Kalidāsā's venerable poetry — Meghadūtam — as interactive, three-dimensional typographic forms, moving through space. Type is
viewed through the lens of computation to weave form, motion and interaction to take readers through the poem’s emotional journey. If poetry is a mere shadow of emotions felt, by asking a shadow to dance, we urge to bring words to life, to hold a stronger presence, a deeper voice.</p>

He also works on HCD toolkits and conducts design thinking workshops with a wide variety of clients.
</p>
<p>A fledgling NLP. Natural Language Processing algorithms have become incredibly powerful as of late, and in the quest to create his own, he discovered the wonderful possibilities of crafting an NLP to write poems and stories. A fledgling NLP algorithm which happens to be poetic and has not yet learnt the restrictions of the English language is capable of writing astonishing literature.
